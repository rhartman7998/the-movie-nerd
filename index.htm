<p>Halloween is a film by John Carter made in 1978. This was the kick-off film that spawned a franchise including 12 sequels. The film series was orginally intended to be an anthology; which is why Michale Meyers did not apear in the third film. Halloween 1978 follows a mental patient who escapes from the hospital to go back to his hometown and kill the last remaining member of his family.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite scenes from the original 1996 Scream. Billy Loomis pretends to be stabbed by the masked killer Ghostface. He proceeded to layout his elaborate plan. The movie being meta and very self-aware it references both Psycho and Carrie. With Billy saying.”Mmmm….corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pigs blood in Carrie.” 
The quote,”We all go a little mad sometimes” comes from Psycho.</p>
