<h1>About Us</h1>
<img src="images/me.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" style="float:right">
<p>My name is Robert Hartman. I am an avid movie watcher and collector. I like all genres of film, however my favorite genre is horror; specifically slashers and phychological thrillers.<p>

<p>I started watching movies at a young age. I use movies as an escape from reality. The first horror movie I remember watching is Halloween from 1978. This movie holds nestalgic value to me because growing up very conservative we were not allowed to watch anything like this.</p>

<p>I watched Hallowen at my cousins house over Christmas break one year. I was probably 10 or 11. Afterwards I was instantly hooked and fell in love with Horror movies. I would watch them laste at night on cable after my parents went to bed.</p> 

<p>I wanted to start this page to share my love  and opinion about movies with others. I own over 1000 movies in my personal collection. Hopefully I will inspire another group of young film buffs like myself.
